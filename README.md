# Twinkle (Ed6767 fork)

Twinkle is a JavaScript application that gives Wikipedians a quick way of performing common maintenance tasks, such as nominating pages for deletion and cleaning up vandalism.

See [Wikipedia:Twinkle][] on the English Wikipedia for more information.

[AzaToth][] is the original author and maintainer of the tool, as well as the `morebits.js` library gadget, which forms the basis for many Wikipedia scripts and editing tools in addition to Twinkle.

## Goal of this fork

* Make Twinkle easier to develop!
* Finally bring Twinkle into the 2010s by implimenting OOUI features, which can be enabled/disabled in preferences if people don't like them
* Increase Twinkle's user friendliness by implimenting some tweaks

## B-but didn't you already make RedWarn?

Yes, but Twinkle covers a much wider scope than RedWarn does and all tools should be accessable for all Wikimedians, both the computer litterate and illiterate.
